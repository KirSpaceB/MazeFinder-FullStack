# MazeSolver

Visually represents searching algorithms such as BFS and DFS. Obstacles such as walls can be manually implemented to further visalize the algorithms traversal.
Written unit and integration tests for each feature are currently WIP.

# How to run
1. Clone the project from github
2. Install the Live Server extension if using VS Code. Other wise open the html file in the browser.
3. Must select the size of the maze using the slider before users can run set points or start algorithms.

# Features
- Add Wall: By hovering over the grid, users can place a wall which the algorithm will avoid.
- Gravity Mode: Once walls are created on the grid, activating Gravity Mode will cause the walls to fall to the bottom of the grid.
- Reset: This function resets the grid. However, the user will need to select the size again using the slider.

Issues:
- Sorting algorithms are currently WIP.
- Start point and end points will be absorbed by the walls.
